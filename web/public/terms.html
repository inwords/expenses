<h1>Terms of Use</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated: November 14, 2025</strong></p>
<p>These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the CommonEx mobile and web applications (“CommonEx” or the “Service”). By downloading, installing, or using CommonEx, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, please do not use the Service.</p>
<h2>1. Introduction and Acceptance</h2>
<p>CommonEx is an application designed to help groups of friends or participants track and split expenses for events or activities. The Service is provided to you by the developer, InWords  (“we,” “us,” or “our”). We provide CommonEx free of charge and without ads, to offer a convenient expense-sharing tool with no registration required.</p>
<p>By using CommonEx, you confirm that you have read and understood these Terms and agree to abide by them. These Terms form a binding legal agreement between you and us. If you are using CommonEx on behalf of an organization or group, you represent that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms, and “you” as used in these Terms includes both you as an individual and that organization.</p>
<h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
<p>You must be at least 16 years old to use CommonEx. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are 16 or older, or if you are not, that you have the consent of a parent or legal guardian to use the Service (however, please note that our Privacy Policy states we do not knowingly collect data from under-16 users; therefore, the Service is not intended for those under 16). If you are under 16 years of age, you are not permitted to use this app.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to ensure that your use of CommonEx complies with all laws and regulations applicable to you, including any age restrictions and privacy regulations in your country of residence.</p>
<h2>3. No Account Registration; Event Credentials</h2>
<p>CommonEx does not require you to create a personal user account or profile. Instead, the Service operates on an event-based model:</p>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Event ID and PIN:</strong> When you create an event (a trip, activity, or group expense list), the system will generate a unique Event Identifier (ID) and a PIN code or password for that event. These credentials serve as the “keys” to access the event’s expenses. Anyone in possession of both the Event ID and its PIN can join and view/edit that event’s information.</li>
   <li><strong>Sharing Access:</strong> You are responsible for distributing the Event ID and PIN to those participants whom you want to have access to the event. Treat the PIN like a password: only share it with people you trust. We recommend sharing these details privately (for example, via a secure message to your friends) and not posting them in any public forum, to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
   <li><strong>Access Without Further Verification:</strong> Because we do not have user accounts or additional login steps, anyone who knows an event’s ID and PIN is considered an authorized user of that event. We do not perform identity verification. By using the app, you acknowledge that the security of your event data relies on keeping the event credentials confidential. We are not liable for any losses or privacy breaches if an unauthorized person gains access to an event due to the credentials being shared or guessed.</li>
   <li><strong>No Password Recovery:</strong> Since we do not collect your email or create accounts, we cannot recover or reset your event PIN if you lose it. If you forget the PIN to an event, you will lose access to that event’s data unless someone else who joined the event can remind you of the PIN. Always keep a safe record of your active Event IDs and PINs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. User Responsibilities and Acceptable Use</h2>
<p>We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, revocable, limited license to use CommonEx for its intended purpose of tracking and sharing expenses with your friends or group. In using the Service, you agree to the following acceptable use terms:</p>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Lawful Purposes:</strong> You will use CommonEx only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You must not use the app to engage in any illegal activities or to facilitate any unlawful acts. This includes, for example, not using CommonEx to launder money, commit fraud, or fund any illicit activities.</li>
   <li><strong>Accurate Information:</strong> You are responsible for ensuring that the information you enter into CommonEx (such as expense amounts, descriptions, and participant names) is accurate to the best of your knowledge. CommonEx provides calculations and summaries based on what you input; we are not responsible for any errors or misunderstandings arising from incorrect data entry by users.</li>
   <li><strong>Respect for Others’ Privacy:</strong> If you include personal information about others in the app (for example, adding a participant’s full name or any identifying detail), you should have their permission. Do not use CommonEx to store or share highly sensitive personal data about others without consent. You also agree not to harvest or collect personal information of other CommonEx users (for example, if you somehow gained access to events that are not yours, which you should not attempt to do).</li>
   <li><strong>No Unauthorized Access:</strong> You must not attempt to access events or data that you are not authorized to access. This means you should not try to guess or hack Event IDs or PINs that haven’t been shared with you. Any attempt to breach the security or to access other users’ events without permission is a violation of these Terms and may also be a violation of law.</li>
   <li><strong>No Harmful Interference:</strong> You agree not to disrupt or interfere with the Service’s operation or other users’ ability to use CommonEx. This includes not introducing viruses, worms, malware, or any other harmful code into the app or our servers, and not performing any actions that could impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure (e.g., spamming our servers with requests).</li>
   <li><strong>No Reverse Engineering:</strong> You will not attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or extract the source code of the CommonEx apps or backend, except to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law. (Note: Portions of CommonEx’s software may be open source – those components are governed by their own licenses, but unauthorized tampering with the service backend or circumventing security measures is prohibited.)</li>
   <li><strong>No Misuse or Exploitation:</strong> You will not use CommonEx in any manner that could disable, overburden, damage, or impair the Service, or interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment of the Service. Also, you may not use the app to solicit personal or sensitive information from other users except as needed for splitting expenses (for example, it’s fine to input a friend’s name for an expense, but not to use the app to ask for their passwords or other unrelated personal data).</li>
   <li><strong>User Content Standards:</strong> You must not enter or upload any content into CommonEx that is offensive, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise violates any third-party rights (such as intellectual property rights or privacy rights). While CommonEx primarily deals with numerical and textual expense data, any descriptive text you add (like expense descriptions or event names) should be appropriate and lawful. You are solely responsible for the content you input. We do not actively monitor user-entered content, but if it comes to our attention that content is unlawful or in violation of these Terms, we reserve the right to remove it or take appropriate action.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. User-Generated Content and Data</h2>
<p>All information that you and other users input into CommonEx (such as event details, participant names, expenses, and related data) is considered “User-Generated Content.” We do not claim ownership of your User-Generated Content. You retain all rights to the content you enter. However, by using CommonEx and submitting content, you grant us a license to use that content as necessary to operate and provide the Service.</p>
<ul>
   <li><strong>License to Use Content:</strong> Specifically, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, sub-licensable right to host, store, reproduce, modify, and display your content *solely* for the purposes of operating, developing, and improving the Service. For example, we may need to modify data format for storage or display (e.g., converting currency amounts or adjusting formatting for different screen sizes), or make backup copies for safety. We will never use your content for other purposes such as marketing or selling it to others.</li>
   <li><strong>Sharing with Participants:</strong> As noted, any content in an event will be accessible to all participants of that event who have the credentials. By entering content into a CommonEx event, you are instructing us to share that content with anyone who uses the correct Event ID and PIN. If you do not want certain information shared, do not input it into an event or do not share the event credentials with those individuals.</li>
   <li><strong>No Public Display by Us:</strong> We will not display your personal event data publicly. CommonEx has no public feed or searchable index of events. We do not use your expense data as testimonials or examples without permission. All event data remains private to the event’s participants (and our internal servers as needed to provide the service).</li>
   <li><strong>Data Responsibility:</strong> You are responsible for maintaining backups of any data you consider important. While we take precautions with our servers, we cannot guarantee that your data will never be lost or corrupted. The app is provided “as is” (see Disclaimer below), and there could be rare cases of data loss. We recommend keeping important expense records separately if needed, especially if required for official purposes (CommonEx is a convenience tool, not an official accounting system).</li>
   <li><strong>Content Removal:</strong> If you wish to remove certain content, you generally can do so by editing or deleting expenses or events through the app. If an entire event needs to be deleted from the Service and you cannot do so directly in the app, please contact us. We reserve the right (though we have no obligation) to remove any content that we deem violates these Terms or that is necessary to remove under law or at the request of authorities or affected parties. We will typically notify the creator (if identifiable) in such cases.</li>
</ul>
<h2>6. Privacy and Data Protection</h2>
<p>Your privacy is important to us. Our collection and use of personal information in connection with the Service is described in our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> (above). By using CommonEx, you consent to the collection and use of information as outlined in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Key points regarding privacy:</p>
<ul>
   <li>We do not require a login or account, and we minimize the personal data collected. However, any personal data that is collected or entered (like names or device identifiers) will be handled according to the Privacy Policy.</li>
   <li>The app uses third-party services (such as Sentry for crash reports). By using the app, you agree that these third-party services may receive data as described in the Privacy Policy. These services are bound by their own terms, but we integrate them in a way to respect user privacy and applicable data protection laws.</li>
   <li>If you are subject to specific privacy rights (for example, GDPR in the EU or CCPA in California), our Privacy Policy explains how you can exercise those rights. We aim to be compliant with major privacy regulations and will cooperate with users in resolving any privacy-related concerns.</li>
</ul>
<h2>7. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
<p><strong>Our Intellectual Property:</strong> All rights, title, and interest in and to the CommonEx Service (excluding user-provided content) are and will remain the exclusive property of InWords (the developer) and any applicable licensors or open-source contributors. This includes the software (code), design, logos, trademarks, and all content provided by us within the app or website (except your own data).</p>
<ul>
   <li>The name “CommonEx” and our logo are trademarks/service marks. You may not use them without our prior written consent, except as necessary to identify the app (for example, you can obviously use the name when discussing the app, but you can’t brand your own service with our name or logo).</li>
   <li>The CommonEx software is provided under license for your use – we are not selling it to you. You may not copy, distribute, or create derivative works of our app except as allowed by law or expressly permitted by us. (If portions of the app are released under an open-source license, those portions may be used according to their license; this does not automatically apply to the entire app or service.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>User’s Intellectual Property:</strong> As noted in Section 5, you retain ownership of the content you input. By submitting content, you simply give us permission to use it as needed to provide the service. We do not obtain any ownership of your data. If you provide us with feedback, suggestions, or ideas about CommonEx (“Feedback”), you agree that we may use such Feedback without restriction or compensation to you, to improve or modify our Service. You are not obligated to provide Feedback, but we appreciate it as it helps make CommonEx better.</p>
<h2>8. Disclaimers of Warranty</h2>
<p>CommonEx is provided to you <strong>“as is” and “as available”</strong>, without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We make no guarantees that:</p>
<ul>
   <li>The Service will be available at all times, uninterrupted, or error-free. (We strive for high availability, but technical issues or maintenance may occasionally cause downtime.)</li>
   <li>The Service will meet your specific requirements or expectations. (For example, we can’t guarantee it will perfectly fit every use case for splitting expenses, or that all calculations will always be error-free if input data is incorrect.)</li>
   <li>The data displayed (such as balances owed) is perfectly accurate or up-to-date at all times. While we aim for accuracy in calculations, the results depend on user-entered data. Always double-check important calculations, especially before making financial settlements.</li>
   <li>The software will be free of viruses or other harmful components, although we take security measures to protect the app and infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<p>We disclaim all implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. For example, we do not warrant that using CommonEx will result in actual reimbursement of debts among your friends — that’s between you and your friends! The app is a tool to facilitate tracking, but we can’t guarantee human behavior or that debts will be paid.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of certain warranties, so some of the above disclaimers may not fully apply to you. In such cases, those warranties are disclaimed to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
<h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall InWords (the developer of CommonEx) or any affiliates, partners, or licensors be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, loss of data, or loss of goodwill, arising out of or in connection with your access to or use of (or inability to use) the Service, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, and whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage.</p>
<p>To the extent we may be liable for any claims under these Terms, our aggregate liability will be limited to the amount of zero (0) US dollars, because the app is provided for free. In other words, since you are not paying anything to use CommonEx, our liability to you is limited to the maximum extent that it can be in a free service scenario. This reflects the allocation of risk: you use the app voluntarily and at your own risk, understanding its limitations.</p>
<p>For example, we are not liable if: the app miscalculates a split and you end up paying more than expected in your group; or if someone unauthorized accesses your event because they obtained the PIN; or if our service is temporarily unavailable and this inconveniences you. Always have a backup plan for important financial records. CommonEx is a convenience tool, not a failsafe financial system.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations of liability, so the above limitation may not apply to you in full. In such jurisdictions, our liability is limited to the minimum extent permitted by law.</p>
<h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
<p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless InWords (the CommonEx developer) and any affiliates, agents, or partners, from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees and costs) that arise out of or relate to:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Your use or misuse of CommonEx,</li>
   <li>Your violation of any of these Terms,</li>
   <li>Your violation of any applicable law or regulation (for example, if you use CommonEx in a way that violates a financial regulation or someone’s rights), or</li>
   <li>Your content or data inputs, including any claims that content you entered into the Service infringes or violates the rights of any third party (such as a claim that you defamed someone in an expense note, or violated someone’s privacy by posting their personal info without consent).</li>
</ul>
<p>We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (meaning, we might handle a legal claim ourselves, but you’ll still be on the hook for the liabilities if it was due to your actions). In such case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of that claim. You will not settle any claim that involves a liability or admission of fault on the part of CommonEx or its developer without our prior written consent.</p>
<h2>11. Service Modifications and Termination</h2>
<p><strong>Modifications to Service:</strong> We are continuously improving CommonEx and adding new features. We reserve the right to modify, update, or discontinue the Service (or any part of it) at any time, temporarily or permanently, with or without notice. For example, we may release updates that change the functionality or appearance of the app, or we may decide to discontinue the web version if necessary. We will try to notify users (for instance, via an in-app announcement or on our website) of major changes that could significantly affect usage.</p>
<p><strong>Termination by You:</strong> You can stop using CommonEx at any time. If you wish to delete your data, see the Privacy Policy for guidance on data deletion. Uninstalling the app will stop your use, but it will not automatically notify us to delete any server-side event data you were involved in. If you want that data removed, please contact us as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Termination or Suspension by Us:</strong> We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service (or certain events) if we have reason to believe that: (i) you have violated these Terms or any applicable law, (ii) you are misusing the Service in a way that could cause harm to other users or to us, (iii) we need to do so to comply with a legal requirement or court order, or (iv) our Service is no longer offered (for example, if we shut down the app entirely).</p>
<p>Because we do not have individual user accounts, any such termination would likely involve revoking access to specific events or disabling the app entirely. If feasible and lawful, we will attempt to give you notice of the termination or suspension of service (e.g., via a notice on our website or an email if we have it from a support contact). However, in urgent cases (such as malicious activity), we may terminate access immediately without notice.</p>
<p>Upon termination of your access, whether by you or us, the following provisions of these Terms will survive: Sections relating to Indemnification, Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability, Intellectual Property (to the extent of rights granted and reserved), and any other clauses which by their nature should survive termination (e.g., governing law, dispute resolution).</p>
<h2>12. Third-Party Services and Links</h2>
<p>CommonEx itself does not include advertisements or third-party social features, but it may contain links or integrations to third-party services for specific purposes (for instance, a link to our blog or a help page, or the use of Sentry which runs in the background). Any third-party services that you access through CommonEx are subject to the terms and conditions of those third parties. For example:</p>
<ul>
   <li>If we provide a link to a website (such as a help article on commonex.ru or a hyperlink to an external resource for currency conversion details), once you click those links you are leaving our Service. We are not responsible for the content or practices of external sites.</li>
   <li>Our integration of Sentry or any analytics does not mean you have a direct relationship with Sentry; we simply use their tool under our account. We ensure any such service complies with privacy commitments, but any data processing by them is governed by our agreements with them.</li>
</ul>
<p>You agree that we are not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any interactions with third-party services that are not directly under our control.</p>
<h2>13. Governing Law</h2>
<p>To the extent permitted by law, these Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the use of CommonEx shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Serbia, without regard to its conflict of law principles. We choose Serbia law in part because the developer is based in Serbia, and we want a consistent legal framework.</p>
<p>If you are a consumer residing outside of Serbia, you may have additional rights under mandatory consumer protection laws of your country of residence, which will apply to you to the extent those laws are applicable and cannot be waived by contract. These Terms are not intended to deprive you of the protection of such mandatory laws.</p>
<h2>14. Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p><strong>Informal Resolution:</strong> We encourage you to contact us first if you have any issues or disputes with CommonEx. Often, disputes can be resolved quickly and amicably through our support channels. You can reach us at <a href="mailto:support@commonex.ru">support@commonex.ru</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Jurisdiction and Venue:</strong> Subject to any applicable consumer laws, any disputes that escalate to a legal case shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Belgrade, Serbia. By agreeing to these Terms, you consent to the jurisdiction of such courts (unless another jurisdiction’s laws explicitly give you the right to choose differently, e.g., EU consumers might be able to bring claims in their home country).</p>
<p><strong>No Class Actions:</strong> To the extent permitted by law, you and we agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or our individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Class actions, collective arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, or any other representative actions are not allowed under these Terms. (This clause may not be enforceable in some jurisdictions, but it is our intent to limit dispute resolution to individual cases.)</p>
<h2>15. Changes to the Terms</h2>
<p>We may update or modify these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide reasonable notice to users. This could be done by posting the updated Terms on our website <em>and/or</em> through an in-app notification. The “Last updated” date at the top of this page will always indicate when the last changes were made.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically. By continuing to use CommonEx after changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not agree to the new Terms, you must stop using the Service.</p>
<h2>16. Miscellaneous</h2>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Entire Agreement:</strong> These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of CommonEx. They supersede any prior agreements or communications (whether oral or written) between you and us relating to the Service.</li>
   <li><strong>Waiver and Severability:</strong> Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from the Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, which will remain in full force and effect.</li>
   <li><strong>Assignment:</strong> You may not assign or transfer these Terms (or any of your rights or obligations under them) without our prior written consent. We may assign or transfer these Terms or our rights/obligations to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise. These Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns.</li>
   <li><strong>Third-Party Beneficiaries:</strong> These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. No other person or company shall be a third-party beneficiary to these Terms.</li>
   <li><strong>Translations:</strong> These Terms are provided in English. If we provide a translation of the English version of these Terms, the English version will prevail in case of conflict, unless prohibited by local law in your jurisdiction. (We may offer translations for convenience, especially for Russian-speaking users, but the English text is the legal reference.)</li>
</ul>
