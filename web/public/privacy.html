<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated: November 14, 2025</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to CommonEx! We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, how we share it, and your choices regarding your information when you use CommonEx via our mobile apps or website.</p>
<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We collect both information that you provide to us directly and information that is collected automatically when you use CommonEx:</p>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Information You Provide:</strong> When you create or participate in an event on CommonEx, you may enter data such as the <em>event name</em>, <em>participant names</em>, and details of expenses (expense descriptions, amounts, and which participants are involved). This information is considered <em>user-generated content</em> and is stored so that you and others with access to the event can view and share the expenses.</li>
   <li><strong>Personal Identifiers:</strong> We do not require account registration, but the app may generate unique identifiers (such as an event ID and PIN code) to allow syncing and sharing of your event data across devices. We may also collect a device identifier or similar ID for the purpose of syncing data and ensuring each device can retrieve the correct events.</li>
   <li><strong>Usage Data & Analytics:</strong> We collect information about how you interact with the app to help us improve our service. This includes in-app actions and usage statistics (for example, the features you use and how often you use the app). We use a crash reporting and analytics tool (Sentry) that automatically collects diagnostics such as app crash logs, error reports, and performance data. This may include device information (device model, operating system version), and the time and frequency of app use.</li>
   <li><strong>Device and Network Information:</strong> When you use CommonEx, certain information may be received automatically, such as your device’s IP address, operating system, browser type (for web access), and other technical data. This information is typically collected as part of server logs or through Sentry for security and troubleshooting purposes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Providing and Syncing the Service:</strong> We use your event and expense data to display it back to you and any friends you have shared the event with. The data you input (names, expenses, amounts) is processed so that all invited participants can view the updated expense lists and balances. We also use identifiers to synchronize data across your devices, allowing you to access your events from multiple devices instantly.</li>
   <li><strong>Offline Functionality:</strong> CommonEx is designed to work offline. Your event data is stored locally on your device so you can use the app without an internet connection. When you go online, the data synchronizes with our server to update all participants. We use your device’s storage solely to enable this offline access and syncing capability.</li>
   <li><strong>Improvement and Development:</strong> Usage information and diagnostic data (such as crash reports from Sentry) are used to understand how users interact with CommonEx and to identify bugs or areas for improvement. For example, crash logs help us fix stability issues, and usage statistics help us make the app more user-friendly. We analyze this data in aggregate form and do not use it to profile individual users for marketing.</li>
   <li><strong>Customer Support and Communication:</strong> If you contact us with a question or feedback (for example, via email), we will use your contact information and the details you provide to respond to you and resolve any issues. We do not send marketing emails or push notifications at this time, since we do not collect contact details through the app itself.</li>
   <li><strong>Security and Fraud Prevention:</strong> We may use IP addresses, device identifiers, and usage logs to monitor for suspicious or unauthorized activity (such as someone attempting to access an event without the correct credentials) and to protect the integrity of our service. This helps us ensure that only users who have the correct Event ID and PIN can access an event’s details.</li>
   <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Where necessary, we may process and disclose information to comply with a legal obligation or governmental request (for example, responding to lawful requests by public authorities) or to enforce our terms of service and protect our rights or the rights of other users.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
<p>We value your trust and only share personal data in a few limited circumstances:</p>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Sharing with Event Participants:</strong> The core purpose of CommonEx is to share expenses among friends. If you create or join an event, all information in that event (event name, participant names, expenses, and who paid/owes what) will be visible to anyone who has the Event ID and PIN for that event. <em>We do not publish your events publicly.</em> Only people to whom you or other event members provide the event link or credentials will have access. Please keep your event’s PIN code confidential and only share it with trusted participants.</li>
   <li>
      <strong>Service Providers and Partners:</strong> We use third-party service providers to help operate and improve CommonEx: 
      <ul>
         <li><em>Sentry:</em> We use Sentry (a crash reporting and performance monitoring service) to collect crash logs and diagnostics. This means that when the app crashes or encounters errors, information about the error and your device (like device model, OS, and possibly your IP at the time of the error) is sent to Sentry’s servers. Sentry acts as our data processor for this purpose, helping us fix issues. Sentry is operated by Functional Software, Inc., and we have configured Sentry to use servers in the EU region for data storage where possible.</li>
         <li><em>Hosting Provider:</em> Our backend servers are hosted by a third-party hosting provider (LLHost, located in the Netherlands). This means that any data stored on our server (such as your event information) resides on their infrastructure. The hosting provider may technically have access to the data on the server hardware, but they are not permitted to use or disclose your data except as needed to maintain the server. We have taken steps to secure our servers through this provider.</li>
         <li><em>Currency Exchange API:</em> To support multi-currency expenses, CommonEx may use a third-party API (such as Open Exchange Rates) to retrieve currency conversion rates. When we request exchange rates, we do not send any personal data about users—only the request for conversion values (e.g. asking for the rate between USD and EUR). No user-identifying information is involved in these requests.</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li><strong>Legal and Safety Disclosures:</strong> We will share personal information outside of CommonEx if we have a good-faith belief that such sharing is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request; (b) enforce our Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations; or (c) protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of our users, the public, or CommonEx as permitted or required by law.</li>
   <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If in the future we (the CommonEx app or its developer) are involved in a merger, acquisition, investment, or asset sale, your information may be transferred to the new owner as part of that transaction. If such a transfer occurs, we will ensure the new owner honors the commitments we've made in this Privacy Policy and will notify you (for example, via a notice on our website or within the app) of any choices you may have regarding your information.</li>
   <li><strong>Non-Personal & Aggregated Data:</strong> We may share aggregated or de-identified information (which cannot be used to identify you personally) publicly or with partners – for example, statistics about overall app usage or total number of events – for research, marketing, or benchmarking purposes. Such information contains no personal data and cannot be traced back to individual users.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Data Storage and International Transfer</h2>
<p><strong>Data Location:</strong> CommonEx stores user event data on your device and on our secure servers located in the Netherlands (European Union). Crash reports and diagnostic data collected via Sentry are transmitted to Sentry’s servers (which, under our configuration, reside in Europe). By using CommonEx, you acknowledge that your information will be transferred to and stored on servers outside your home country, including in the EU. This is necessary for us to provide the service (for example, to sync your data so your friends can see it).</p>
<p><strong>International Data Transfers:</strong> If you are using the app from outside of the European Union (for instance, in Russia, Serbia or elsewhere), please be aware that the personal data we collect will be transferred to and processed in the EU (specifically, the Netherlands for our servers, and potentially Germany or other EU locations for Sentry). These countries may have data protection laws that are different from those in your country. We ensure that when we transfer data internationally, appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your personal data. For example, we rely on the fact that our EU-based servers comply with GDPR standards for data protection. By continuing to use CommonEx, you agree to this transfer, storing, and processing of your information in the EU.</p>
<p><strong>Data Security:</strong> We take reasonable measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. All data transmission between the mobile app or website and our servers is encrypted using HTTPS (TLS) to prevent eavesdropping. Within our server and database, we apply security best practices to guard data (including access controls and regular security updates). Additionally, the Event ID and PIN system adds a layer of security — only those with the correct combination can access a given event’s details. However, please note that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security. It is important that you also do your part: keep your event PIN codes confidential and be cautious about who you share links or credentials with.</p>
<h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
<p>We retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy and to provide the CommonEx service to you. In practice, this means:</p>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Event Data:</strong> The expenses and event information you enter will be retained on our servers until you request deletion or until we determine that the data is no longer needed to provide the service. Currently, we do not enforce a fixed expiration on events; even inactive event data may be stored so that you can return to it later. If you want to delete an event and all its associated data from our servers, you can contact us (see the Contact section below) to request deletion. We plan to introduce in-app options for data deletion in the future as our technology evolves.</li>
   <li><strong>Crash Logs and Analytics:</strong> Diagnostic data collected via Sentry is generally retained for a limited period (for example, crash reports may be kept for a certain number of months) in accordance with Sentry’s data retention policies, and so that we have enough history to troubleshoot issues. Such data is typically purged automatically over time as new data comes in.</li>
   <li><strong>Local Storage on Device:</strong> Any data stored offline on your device (e.g., cached event information) stays on your device until you uninstall the app or clear the app’s data. Removing the app from your device will delete the locally stored copies of your events from that device (but not from our server if the event exists on the server).</li>
   <li><strong>Backups:</strong> Our server may maintain backups or archives for recovery and security purposes. If you request deletion of your data, we will remove it from our active database, but it may remain in encrypted backups for a short period until those backups are rotated and overwritten.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we no longer need personal data for the purposes of providing CommonEx or to comply with legal obligations, we will securely delete or anonymize it so that it can no longer be associated with you.</p>
<h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
<p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you have certain rights regarding your personal data. We strive to uphold these rights for all users:</p>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Access and Portability:</strong> You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you. For CommonEx, this would primarily be the data in your events (names of events, participants, expenses, etc.) and any related usage data. We can provide this information in a common electronic format upon request.</li>
   <li><strong>Rectification:</strong> If you believe that any personal information we have collected is inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to ask us to correct it. In practice, you can edit the data in the app (e.g., change participant names or fix expense entries) at any time, and those changes will be synchronized to our server. If any information (like crash report details) is inaccurate, please let us know and we will address it if possible.</li>
   <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You have the right to request deletion of your personal data. Because CommonEx does not use personal user accounts, the primary way to delete your data is to delete events. If you want all data related to a particular event removed from our servers, the current solution is to contact us and provide the Event ID (and proof of your ownership or participation if needed), and we can delete it manually from our system. In the future, we aim to add a feature to allow event creators to delete their events directly. Note that deleting the app or an event on your device does not automatically erase server data if other participants still have access to that event.</li>
   <li><strong>Objection and Restriction:</strong> You have the right to object to or request that we restrict processing of your data in certain circumstances. For example, you can opt out of any non-essential data collection: since we currently do not use your data for marketing or ads, this primarily means you can opt out of analytics by not allowing crash reports (if the app provides such a toggle). If you have concerns about Sentry’s crash reporting, you may disable analytics in the app settings (if available) or contact us to discuss alternatives.</li>
   <li><strong>Withdrawal of Consent:</strong> In cases where we rely on your consent to process data (for instance, if in the future we ask for consent to collect additional data or to send you communications), you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. (Currently, our processing is mainly based on providing the service and our legitimate interests as described above, rather than explicit consent, but if any feature does rely on consent, you can change your mind easily.)</li>
   <li><strong>Non-Sale of Personal Data:</strong> CommonEx does <em>not</em> sell your personal data to third parties. If you are a user in certain regions like California (USA), you have a right to opt-out of the sale of personal information. We confirm that we do not engage in selling or sharing your data for third-party advertising purposes, so there is no need to opt out of something we don’t do. We treat all user requests regarding data with the same care, regardless of your region.</li>
</ul>
<p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the contact details provided in the “Contact Us” section below. We will respond to your request as soon as possible and in accordance with applicable laws. For security, we might need to verify your identity (for example, by confirming information about your use of the service) before fulfilling certain requests, especially for access or deletion.</p>
<h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>CommonEx is not intended for children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 16 years old. If you are under 16, please do not use the CommonEx app or submit any information about yourself (including your name or those of your friends). If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personal data from a child under 16, we will take steps to delete such information as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Parents or guardians: If you discover that your child under 16 has been using CommonEx and providing personal data without your consent, please contact us immediately. We will work with you to remove the data and terminate the child’s use of the service. While our service by design does not create accounts or profiles, a child could theoretically enter names or information. We want to ensure we respect youth privacy laws (including GDPR’s child data protections and similar rules), so we err on the side of not allowing use by minors under 16 at this time.</p>
<p>In the future, we may consider offering a teen-safe version of the service or enabling use by younger audiences with parental consent, but until then, we restrict the app’s intended audience to users 16 and older by default.</p>
<h2>8. Additional Notices for Certain Jurisdictions</h2>
<p><em>For Users in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, or Switzerland:</em> InWords is the data controller for CommonEx (contact details below). Our legal basis for processing your personal data includes: necessity for performing the service you request (fulfilling our contract with you when you use the app), our legitimate interests in maintaining and improving our app (e.g., using crash logs to enhance stability), and compliance with legal obligations. We do not rely on consent except where we explicitly ask for it. You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority in your country if you believe we have infringed your data protection rights, but we kindly ask that you contact us first so we can address your concerns.</p>
<p><em>For California (CCPA/CPRA):</em> In addition to the rights described above, California residents have the right to know what categories of personal information we collect and how we use and share it. In the past 12 months, CommonEx may have collected the following categories of personal information: identifiers (such as device ID, IP address), personal information (names of individuals if provided as participants), usage data (app interactions), and financial information (expense entries, though not tied to payment instruments). This information is collected for the purposes described in this policy. We do not “sell” your personal information as defined by CCPA, nor do we share it with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising. We also do not profile users in a way that has legal or similarly significant effects. If you send us a request pertaining to your California rights, we will comply as required – for example, providing you with a copy of your information or deleting your data – and we will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights.</p>
<p><em>For Users in Russia:</em> CommonEx does not publicly distribute or list personal data, but please be aware that by using the service, your personal data (such as participant names or expense details you enter) will be stored on servers outside of Russia (in the Netherlands). By using CommonEx, you consent to this transfer and storage of your personal data abroad. We handle your data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and take measures to protect it. If Russian law grants you specific data rights, you can exercise them by contacting us. We strive to be transparent and cooperative with users from all regions. (Note: If required by Russian law, we may consider local data storage in future updates, but at present data is hosted in the EU.)</p>
<h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technologies, legal requirements, or other factors. If we make significant changes, we will notify you by posting the updated Privacy Policy on our website (and within the app if applicable) and updating the “Last updated” date at the top. In some cases, if changes are material, we may provide a more prominent notice or seek your consent as required by law.</p>
<p>We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information. Your continued use of CommonEx after any changes to this Policy will signify your acceptance of the updated terms, to the extent permitted by law.</p>
